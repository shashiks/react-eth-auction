This is a demo project with samples for :
<ul>
<li>Ethereum Smart Contract</li>
<li>IPFS</li>
</ul>

<p>It uses ReactJS as the frontend framework, bootstrap for layouts, webpack for packaging.<p>
<p>Truffle is used for communicating with ETH and deploying code to blockchain</p>

There are lots of optimizations pending. Particularaly:
<ul>
<li>React component isolation between view and data</li>
<li>Bootstrap view updates in place instead of full page refresh</li>
</ul>
But for now the code is more of a sample to work with ETH and IPS. The front end optimizations
would happen in future.

Feel free to use this as a template to get started on these technologies.
